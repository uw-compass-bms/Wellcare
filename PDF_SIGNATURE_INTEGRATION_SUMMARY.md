  - Performance optimized with virtualization
  - Mobile responsive
  - Full API integration
  - Undo/redo support
  - Keyboard shortcuts

### 3. **Cleaned Up Files**
- Removed all test pages
- Removed development components
- Removed temporary documentation
- Simplified exports to only production-ready components

### 4. **Production File Structure**
```

## Integration Points

### 1. **Task Creation Flow**
```
Create Task → Upload Files → Add Recipients → Setup Signatures → Publish
                                                      ↑
                                            [New Integration]
```

### 2. **API Endpoints Used**
- `GET /api/signature/positions?taskId={taskId}` - Load existing fields
- `POST /api/signature/positions` - Create new field
- `PUT /api/signature/positions/{id}` - Update field
- `DELETE /api/signature/positions/{id}` - Delete field
- `POST /api/signature/tasks/{taskId}/publish` - Publish task

### 3. **Navigation Flow**
- From: `/app/signature/create-task/{taskId}`
- To: `/app/signature/pdf/{taskId}`
- After publish: `/app/signature`
