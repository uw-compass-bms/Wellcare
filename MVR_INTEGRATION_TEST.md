# MVR Integration System - Test Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ System Overview

We have successfully integrated the MVR (Motor Vehicle Records) document extraction with automatic database storage and case management.

## ðŸ“Š Components Created

### 1. Database Tables (`create_mvr_database.sql`)
- `mvr_records` - Main MVR record table
- `mvr_conditions` - License conditions/restrictions  
- `mvr_convictions` - Traffic convictions/violations

### 2. Supabase Client Functions (`src/lib/supabase/client.ts`)
- `saveMVRData()` - Save single MVR record
- `saveMVRDataBatch()` - Save multiple MVR records  
- `getMVRRecords()` - Retrieve user's MVR records
- `deleteMVRRecord()` - Delete MVR record
- `updateMVRRecord()` - Update MVR record

### 3. Document Verification Integration (`src/app/app/document-verification/`)
- Auto-save functionality after successful MVR extraction
- Status notifications for save operations
- Link to Case Management after successful save

### 4. Case Management System (`src/app/app/client-management/`)
- Case overview with document type summaries
- Detailed MVR record viewing
- Client grouping by license number + name
- Full CRUD operations for MVR data

## ðŸ§ª Testing Steps

### Step 1: Setup Database
1. Run the SQL script `create_mvr_database.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Verify tables are created successfully

### Step 2: Test Document Extraction + Auto-Save
1. Go to `/app/document-verification`
2. Upload MVR documents (single or multiple)
3. Click "Process Files"
4. Verify you see save status notifications
5. Confirm success message with link to Case Management

### Step 3: Test Case Management
1. Go to `/app/client-management` 
2. Verify case appears in overview with:
   - Client name and license number
   - Document count (MVR: X, others: 0)
   - Last updated timestamp
3. Click "View Details" on a case
4. Verify MVR records display with:
   - Personal information
   - License details
   - Conditions (if any) with yellow highlighting
   - Convictions (if any) with red highlighting

### Step 4: Test CRUD Operations
1. In case details, verify you can:
   - View all MVR record details
   - Delete individual MVR records
   - Navigate back to overview

## âœ… Expected Results

- âœ… MVR data extracted from documents
- âœ… Data automatically saved to database  
- âœ… Cases grouped by client identity
- âœ… Detailed record viewing with formatted conditions/convictions
- âœ… Full CRUD operations
- âœ… User isolation (each user only sees their own data)

## ðŸš€ Next Steps for Full System

This MVR integration serves as the foundation. The same pattern will be extended for:

1. **Auto+ Reports** - Insurance history records
2. **Quote Documents** - Multi-vehicle, multi-driver quotes  
3. **Application Forms** - Complete insurance applications

Each document type will have its own database tables and integration following this same pattern.

## ðŸ”§ Development Notes

- All code written in English (comments in Chinese allowed)
- User isolation through Clerk user IDs
- RLS disabled for simplicity (can be enabled later)
- Graceful error handling throughout
- Responsive UI design
- Automatic data relationship management
